# wizeline-session3
This repository was created in order to deliver my assessment for session 3 regarding test certification provided by wizeline

#The main project.

1. Firstly you need to export the env variable for the TOKEN regarding your todoist account
2. Execute the npm install command to install the project dependencies
3. The next step is to execute the npm task:
 
 `npm run test`
 
 This should trigger the execution and also generate the report.html file inside the results folder.
 
 And that's pretty much it! :D
